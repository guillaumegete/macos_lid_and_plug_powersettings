# macOS lid and plug Powers Settings

This script allows to choose the behavior of an Apple Silicon Macbook Pro/Air when a power cable is connected or the lid opened. 
More info here: https://support.apple.com/120622
It requires SwiftDialog (https://github.com/swiftDialog)

English and French version are provided. Feel free to modify for your own languages.

This script requires root, so the best way to use it is to add it to your Self Service in Jamf Pro to allow the user to run it as they wish. You should scope only to Apple Silicon  MacBook (Air/Pro).
